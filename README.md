Malnesia: a single player, climate change inspired, text-based game. 

My programâ€™s theme reworks the trope of being stuck on a deserted island. Malnesia, the imaginary nation state to which this program gets its name (some combination between the Maldives and Indonesia), is the first nation to have its population relocated due to impacts of climate change, namely sea level rise. The game allows users to select the individual who was left behind from four character types, to which each has their own particular strengths and unique traits. The objective of the game is to acquire necessary materials for building a raft to leave the island and the player can find the necessary items as they move around to the different spaces on the island.
